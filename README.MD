##Welcome to QuantAnalysis!

This is my attempt to create an analyzer for the equities market. I may add bonds, and derivatives in the, well, _future_.

I will be using a Jersey Server with a Postgres backend, and a React frontend. This will also be a learning experience since I havent created a complicated web app with those tools!

###Current Goals:

- Create the securities master database
- Populate the database
- Create REST endpoints in the WebApp that generate JSON objects
- Write a Simple Moving Average algorithm.
- Create a front end that will consume this.


I may eventually use containers but I will be focusing on the features for now vs an infrastructure.
